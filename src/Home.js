                <p>Ahh. There's nothing like the feeling of climbing into a brand new, freshly laundered and put together bed. Now if you could only recreate that feeling every day. Well, you can definitely get close iff you foloow a few tips to maintain your bedding.</p>
                <p>When it comes to sheets, it's important to change and launder your sheets weekly. And if that sounds daunting, know that the payoff is real. Our sheets get softer and softer with every wash, and here's a pro-tip: pull them from the dryer a little early and you can skip ironing. Sheets will flatten beautifully if they'ree not fully dry. If you're storing sheets for the season, or just between washes, make sure that they're fully dried, and don't store in plastic to precent moisture being trapped (which will create mildew, which is...ew).</p>
                <p>Cleaning pillows and comforters is as simple as adding an extra rinse cycle to ensure that all the detergent has been washed out. Tumble dry on the lowest heat settting, and viola. For your down pillows and comforteers, take those to the dry cleaner to maintain loft. All pillow and comforter types should be cleaned every 4 months. So change them with the seasons and you'll have comfort that lasts all year.</p>
